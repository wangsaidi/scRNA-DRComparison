In this study, we systematically evaluated 26 representative single-cell dimensionality reduction (DR) methods applied across a broad spectrum of single-cell sequencing scenarios, encompassing 50 real-world datasets and 50 synthetic datasets. Based on our proposed unified mathematical framework, we categorized existing methods into four major classes and systematically evaluated their performance and robustness across multiple dimensions. This study not only establishes the most comprehensive benchmarking system to date but also theoretically elucidates the underlying mechanisms behind performance variations among different methods. Consequently, it provides actionable and universally applicable guidelines for method selection in practical applications.
